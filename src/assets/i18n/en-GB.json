    "selectionGuide": "<p>To ensure accurate risk stratification using the Cardio Explorer, the choice of the appropriate calibration should be tailored to the clinical setting, such as risk stratification or screening in primary care versus  evaluation by a cardiologist or in a hospital setting (secondary care). </p> <p>The accuracy of a disease prediction model depends on the prevalence of the disease in the population being  tested. Therefore, the cut-off points on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which indicate  the balance between sensitivity and specificity of the model, need to be adjusted based on the prevalence of  the clinical setting where the model is being used. This is typically referred to as calibration. This  calibration process ensures that the model's predictions are accurate and reliable in the specific  population being tested. By adjusting the cut-off point, the model can maintain an appropriate balance  between sensitivity and specificity, which is crucial for accurate disease prediction and diagnosis. </p> <p>  For example, in a hospital population with a high prevalence of CAD, a lower cut-off point on the ROC curve  is appropriate in order to maximize sensitivity and minimize false negatives. Conversely, in a primary care  population with a low prevalence of CAD, a higher cut-off point is needed to maximize specificity and minimize false positives.</p>",
